### What I learned

Through this project, I had the opportunity to improve my skills and gain valuable practice in HTML and CSS. As I worked on coding and designing the webpage, I encountered various challenges that pushed me to think critically and find creative solutions. This hands-on experience allowed me to strengthen my coding abilities, problem-solving skills, and understanding of web development concepts. By actively engaging in projects like this, I continue to refine my skills and enhance my proficiency in HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

For future development, I aim to improve my skills in CSS frameworks, responsive design, browser compatibility, and code optimization. This will enable me to create more efficient, visually appealing, and cross-browser compatible webpages.
